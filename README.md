As with Assignment 1, assume that you're working for Princeton's Registrar's Office. You're given a database containing data about classes and courses offered during an upcoming Princeton semester. Your task is to create a Python application that allows Princeton students and other interested parties to query the database.  Your application must consist of two programs: a client program named reg.py and a server program named regserver.py. Your reg.py program must have a graphical user interface. It must communicate with your regserver.py program, which might be running on the same computer as reg.py, or might be running on a different computer. That is, your application must be networked.
